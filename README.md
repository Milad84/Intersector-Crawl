# Efficiently Assigning Numerical Values from Multiple Intersecting Polygons to Overlapping Areas: A Case Study of Austin Council Districts

This project aims to efficiently assign numerical values from multiple intersecting polygons to overlapping areas, focusing on a case study of Austin Council Districts. It provides a solution to handle one-to-many cardinality issues commonly encountered in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis.

## Overview

The project addresses the challenge of assigning numerical codes to polygons based on the council districts they intersect. Traditional spatial join methods suffer from one-to-one cardinality limitations, leading to incomplete data representation. This project offers a solution to overcome these limitations by accurately identifying and assigning multiple council districts to intersecting polygons.

## Features

- **Efficient Algorithm**: Utilizes ArcPy in ArcGIS Pro to implement an efficient algorithm for identifying intersecting polygons and assigning corresponding council districts.
  
- **One-to-Many Handling**: Handles one-to-many cardinality issues by populating a new TEXT field with comma-separated lists of council district numbers for each polygon.

- **Documentation**: Provides detailed documentation on the workflow, solution components, and potential optimizations.

## Getting Started

To use the script in your ArcGIS Pro environment, follow these steps:

1. Create a new TEXT field in the polygon layer to store the Council District numbers.

2. Open the Field Calculator in ArcGIS Pro and set the expression to:

get_council_districts(!Shape!)

Adjust the name of the fields based on your needs and run the calculation to populate the new field with the Council District numbers for each polygon.

## Slowness Optimization

The project discusses potential factors contributing to slow performance, such as data size, complexity of geometries, intersect analysis, and spatial indexing. It offers insights into optimizing the code and improving processing efficiency.
